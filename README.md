# Rock-Paper-Scissors Detection using MediaPipe Hand

## Overview
- This project utilizes the MediaPipe Hand library to detect hand gestures and classify them into rock, paper, or scissors gestures for playing the popular game. The system captures real-time video input from a webcam or processes pre-recorded videos to identify and classify hand gestures accurately.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection and classification.
- Support for both webcam input and video file processing.
- Intuitive user interface displaying the detected hand gesture and the corresponding classification result.

## Libraries Used
- MediaPipe Hand: Library for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- OpenCV: Library for image and video processing.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computations.

## Files Included
- rock_paper_scissors_detection.py: Python script containing the main code for hand gesture detection and classification.
- README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Usage
- Launch the script rock_paper_scissors_detection.py.
- Position your hand in front of the webcam or provide a video file as input.
- Perform rock, paper, or scissors gestures with your hand.
- The system will detect and classify the gestures in real-time and display the result.
